# GegeChat Improvements

## Error Handling Enhancement in client.c

### Problem
The original client code had inadequate error handling in the child process (reading task). When `recv()` returned a negative value indicating an error, the code would only print an error message and continue looping, potentially leading to:
- Infinite error loops when network connections fail
- Repeated error messages flooding the console
- No proper handling of server disconnections

### Solution Implemented
Enhanced the error handling logic in the child process (lines 93-114) to properly distinguish between different types of recv() return values:

#### Original Code
```c
if (recv(sd, bufferIn, MAXCHR, 0) < 0) {
    perror("C: child recv error");
} else {
    // Process message...
}
```

#### Improved Code
```c
int bytes_received = recv(sd, bufferIn, MAXCHR, 0);
if (bytes_received < 0) {
    if (errno == EINTR) {
        // Interrupted by signal, continue
        continue;
    } else {
        // Real network error, exit
        perror("C: child recv error");
        exit(5);
    }
} else if (bytes_received == 0) {
    // Connection closed by server
    printf("C: server closed connection\n");
    exit(0);
} else {
    // Process message...
}
```

### Improvements Made

1. **Proper Return Value Handling**
   - Store `recv()` return value in `bytes_received` variable
   - Handle three distinct cases: error (<0), connection closed (0), and data received (>0)

2. **Signal Interruption Handling**
   - Check for `EINTR` errno when `recv()` returns -1
   - Continue operation if interrupted by signal (normal behavior)
   - Only exit on real network errors

3. **Server Disconnection Detection**
   - Detect when server closes connection cleanly (`recv()` returns 0)
   - Exit gracefully with status 0 instead of treating as error

4. **Network Error Management**
   - Exit child process on real network errors with status 5
   - Prevent infinite error loops
   - Provide clear error messages

### Benefits

- **Robustness**: Client handles network failures gracefully
- **Standards Compliance**: Follows Unix network programming best practices  
- **User Experience**: Clear feedback on different disconnection scenarios
- **Resource Management**: Prevents runaway processes consuming CPU
- **Debugging**: Appropriate exit codes for different failure modes

### Exit Codes Reference

- `exit(0)`: Normal termination (server closed connection)
- `exit(4)`: Normal termination (received ACK_S "OK" message)
- `exit(5)`: Network error in child process

This enhancement makes the GegeChat client more reliable and suitable for real-world network conditions while maintaining the original fork-based architecture.

## Race Condition Fix: Timeout-based Shutdown

### Problem
The original client had a race condition during shutdown that could cause the application to hang indefinitely:

1. Parent process sends "exit\n" to server and exits main loop
2. Parent process calls `wait()` and blocks, waiting for child to terminate
3. Child process waits for server to send "OK" acknowledgment
4. If server never sends "OK" (due to network issues, server problems, etc.), parent hangs forever

### Original Code
```c
} while (cont);
if (wait(&status) < 0) {
    printf("C: parent wait status 0x%X\n", status);
    perror("C: parent wait error");
} else {
    printf("C: disconnect from server\n");
    close(sd);
}
```

### Improved Code
```c
} while (cont);

// Timeout-based wait for child process
int child_status;
int wait_time = 0;
const int MAX_WAIT_SECONDS = 5;  // 5 second timeout

printf("C: waiting for server acknowledgment...\n");
while (wait_time < MAX_WAIT_SECONDS) {
    pid_t result = waitpid(pid, &child_status, WNOHANG);
    if (result == pid) {
        // Child has terminated normally
        printf("C: disconnect from server\n");
        close(sd);
        return 0;
    } else if (result == -1) {
        perror("C: waitpid error");
        break;
    }
    // Child still running, wait a bit more
    sleep(1);
    wait_time++;
}

if (wait_time >= MAX_WAIT_SECONDS) {
    printf("C: timeout waiting for server response, terminating child\n");
    kill(pid, SIGTERM);  // Send termination signal to child
    sleep(1);            // Give child time to exit gracefully
    if (waitpid(pid, &child_status, WNOHANG) == 0) {
        // Child still running, force kill
        printf("C: forcing child termination\n");
        kill(pid, SIGKILL);
        waitpid(pid, &child_status, 0);
    }
}

close(sd);
```

### Solution Features

1. **Non-blocking Wait**: Uses `waitpid()` with `WNOHANG` to check child status without blocking
2. **Configurable Timeout**: 5-second maximum wait time (easily adjustable)
3. **User Feedback**: Clear messages about shutdown progress
4. **Graceful Termination**: First attempts `SIGTERM` for clean child shutdown
5. **Force Termination**: Uses `SIGKILL` as last resort if child doesn't respond
6. **Proper Cleanup**: Ensures socket closure in all scenarios

### Benefits

- **Prevents Hanging**: Client never waits indefinitely for server response
- **Robust Shutdown**: Handles network failures and unresponsive servers
- **User Experience**: Provides feedback during shutdown process
- **Resource Management**: Guarantees proper cleanup of child process and socket
- **Reliability**: Works correctly even when server-client protocol breaks down

### Shutdown Flow

1. **Normal Case**: Child receives "OK" from server within 5 seconds and exits cleanly
2. **Timeout Case**: After 5 seconds, parent sends `SIGTERM` to child, then `SIGKILL` if needed
3. **Error Case**: Handles `waitpid()` errors gracefully

This improvement eliminates the race condition while preserving the original fork-based architecture and maintaining backward compatibility with properly functioning servers.

## Send Error Handling Enhancement

### Problem
The original client had inadequate error handling in the parent process (writing task) when sending messages to the server. The code would only print an error message and continue in the loop when `send()` failed:

- Could lead to repeated send failures without proper recovery
- No distinction between different types of network errors
- No graceful handling of connection failures
- User would not be informed about connection status

### Original Code
```c
if (send(sd, bufferOut, strlen(bufferOut), 0) < 0) {
    perror("C: parent send error");
}
if (strcmp(bufferOut, MSG_C) == 0) {
    cont = 0;
}
```

### Improved Code
```c
int bytes_sent = send(sd, bufferOut, strlen(bufferOut), 0);
if (bytes_sent < 0) {
    if (errno == EINTR) {
        // Interrupted by signal, try again
        printf("C: send interrupted, retrying...\n");
        continue;
    } else if (errno == EPIPE || errno == ECONNRESET) {
        // Connection broken
        printf("C: connection lost, exiting\n");
        cont = 0;
    } else {
        // Other network error
        perror("C: parent send error");
        printf("C: network error, exiting\n");
        cont = 0;
    }
} else if (bytes_sent == 0) {
    // This shouldn't happen with send(), but handle it
    printf("C: send returned 0, connection may be closed\n");
    cont = 0;
} else {
    // Successful send, check for exit command
    if (strcmp(bufferOut, MSG_C) == 0) {
        cont = 0;
    }
}
```

### Solution Features

1. **Return Value Analysis**: Captures and analyzes `send()` return value
2. **Signal Interruption Handling**: Retries operation when interrupted by signals (`EINTR`)
3. **Connection Failure Detection**: Identifies broken connections (`EPIPE`, `ECONNRESET`)
4. **Graceful Error Handling**: Exits cleanly on network failures instead of looping
5. **User Feedback**: Provides clear messages about error types and actions taken
6. **Edge Case Handling**: Handles the rare case where `send()` returns 0

### Error Categories Handled

- **`EINTR`**: Signal interruption → Retry with user notification
- **`EPIPE`**: Broken pipe (server closed connection) → Graceful exit
- **`ECONNRESET`**: Connection reset by peer → Graceful exit  
- **Other errors**: Generic network failures → Exit with error details
- **Zero return**: Potential connection closure → Graceful exit

### Benefits

- **Robust Network Handling**: Properly handles various network failure scenarios
- **No Infinite Loops**: Prevents repeated failed send attempts
- **User Awareness**: Clear feedback about connection status and errors
- **Graceful Degradation**: Clean shutdown triggers timeout-based child cleanup
- **Signal Safety**: Correctly handles system call interruptions
- **Resource Management**: Ensures proper cleanup when network fails

### Integration with Existing Features

This improvement works seamlessly with the timeout-based shutdown mechanism:
- When parent exits due to send error, it triggers the timeout-based child cleanup
- Maintains the same graceful shutdown flow regardless of exit reason
- Preserves the fork-based architecture while adding network resilience

The enhanced error handling makes the GegeChat client robust against network instability while providing clear feedback to users about connection status.

## Server Socket Reuse Fix (SO_REUSEADDR)

### Problem
The original server code had a common issue on Unix-like systems (including macOS) where restarting the server immediately after shutdown would fail with "Address already in use" error. This occurs because:

- When a TCP server closes, the socket enters TIME_WAIT state
- The OS keeps the port reserved for a period (typically 30-120 seconds)
- Attempting to bind to the same port during this period fails
- This made development and testing difficult, requiring manual waits between server restarts

### Original Code
```c
int openSocket(internet_domain_sockaddr *addr) {
    int sd;

#ifdef IPV6_CHAT
    sd = socket(AF_INET6, SOCK_STREAM, 0);
#else
    sd = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);
#endif
    if (sd < 0) {
        perror("S: openSocket socket error");
        return -1;
    } else {
        printf("S: openSocket socket OK\n");
        // Direct bind without SO_REUSEADDR
        if (bind(sd, (struct sockaddr *)addr, sizeof(*addr)) < 0) {
            perror("S: openSocket bind error");
            return -1;
        }
    }
}
```

### Improved Code
```c
int openSocket(internet_domain_sockaddr *addr) {
    int sd;
    int optval = 1;

#ifdef IPV6_CHAT
    sd = socket(AF_INET6, SOCK_STREAM, 0);
#else
    sd = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);
#endif
    if (sd < 0) {
        perror("S: openSocket socket error");
        return -1;
    } else {
        printf("S: openSocket socket OK\n");

        // Set SO_REUSEADDR to avoid "Address already in use" error
        if (setsockopt(sd, SOL_SOCKET, SO_REUSEADDR, &optval, sizeof(optval)) < 0) {
            perror("S: openSocket setsockopt SO_REUSEADDR error");
            close(sd);
            return -1;
        }

        if (bind(sd, (struct sockaddr *)addr, sizeof(*addr)) < 0) {
            perror("S: openSocket bind error");
            return -1;
        }
    }
}
```

### Solution Features

1. **SO_REUSEADDR Option**: Enables immediate port reuse after server shutdown
2. **Proper Error Handling**: Closes socket and returns error if setsockopt fails
3. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Works on all Unix-like systems (Linux, macOS, BSD)
4. **Development Friendly**: Eliminates waiting periods between server restarts

### Benefits

- **Immediate Restart**: Server can be restarted immediately without "Address already in use" errors
- **Development Efficiency**: No need to wait for TIME_WAIT period to expire
- **Production Ready**: Standard practice for TCP servers
- **Robust Error Handling**: Proper cleanup if socket option setting fails
- **Platform Compatibility**: Consistent behavior across Unix-like systems

### Technical Details

- **SO_REUSEADDR**: Socket option that allows reuse of local addresses
- **optval = 1**: Enables the socket option (non-zero value)
- **Socket Level**: Applied at SOL_SOCKET level, affecting the socket itself
- **Timing**: Must be set after socket creation but before bind()

This improvement follows standard network programming practices and eliminates a common development frustration when working with TCP servers.

## Critical Bug Fix: Dispatch Function Error Handling

### Problem
The most critical issue in the original server code was in the `dispatch()` function at line 95. The error handling logic was fundamentally broken, causing `perror("S: dispatch send error")` to execute **every time** a message was successfully sent to clients, not just when errors occurred.

### Original Problematic Code
```c
void dispatch(int *fd, int i) {
    int k;

    memset(message, 0, MAXCHR);
    sprintf(message, "C%d: %s", i + 1, buffer);
    for (k = 0; k < MAXCON; k++) {
        if ((k != i) && (fd[k] > -1)) {
            if (send(fd[k], message, strlen(message), 0) < 0) {
            }
            perror("S: dispatch send error");  // ← ALWAYS EXECUTES!
        }
    }
}
```

### Root Cause
The `if` statement checking for `send()` failure had an **empty body**, meaning the `perror()` call was outside the conditional block. This caused:
- False error reports on every successful message dispatch
- Confusion about actual network problems
- Log pollution with spurious error messages
- Difficulty diagnosing real network issues

### Fixed Code
```c
void dispatch(int *fd, int i) {
    int k;

    memset(message, 0, MAXCHR);
    snprintf(message, MAXCHR, "C%d: %s", i + 1, buffer);
    for (k = 0; k < MAXCON; k++) {
        if ((k != i) && (fd[k] > -1)) {
            if (send(fd[k], message, strlen(message), 0) < 0) {
                perror("S: dispatch send error");
                // Could also consider closing the connection here if send fails
                // close(fd[k]); fd[k] = -1; nClient--;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Additional Improvements Made
1. **Buffer Safety**: Replaced `sprintf()` with `snprintf()` to prevent buffer overflows
2. **Proper Error Scope**: `perror()` now only executes when `send()` actually fails
3. **Future Enhancement**: Added comment suggesting connection cleanup on send failure

### Benefits
- **Accurate Error Reporting**: Errors only reported when they actually occur
- **Clean Logs**: No more spurious error messages flooding the output
- **Better Debugging**: Real network issues can now be identified
- **Memory Safety**: Buffer overflow protection with `snprintf()`

## Enhanced recv() Error Handling in Server

### Problem
The original server's `communication()` function had inadequate handling of `recv()` return values:
- Did not distinguish between network errors (-1) and client disconnections (0)
- Treated client disconnections as successful operations
- Could not properly detect when clients closed connections gracefully

### Original Code
```c
int communication(int *fd, int i) {
    int out = 0;

    memset(buffer, 0, MAXCHR);
    if (recv(fd[i], buffer, MAXCHR, 0) < 0) {
        perror("S: communication recv error");
    } else {
        // Process message regardless of recv() return value
        printf("S: %s", buffer);
        if (nClient > 1) {
            dispatch(fd, i);
        }
        // ... rest of processing
    }
    return out;
}
```

### Improved Code
```c
int communication(int *fd, int i) {
    int out = 0;
    int bytes_received;

    memset(buffer, 0, MAXCHR);
    bytes_received = recv(fd[i], buffer, MAXCHR, 0);
 
    if (bytes_received < 0) {
        perror("S: communication recv error");
        out = -1; // Signal connection should be closed
    } else if (bytes_received == 0) {
        printf("S: client %d disconnected (recv returned 0)\n", i + 1);
        out = -1; // Signal connection should be closed
    } else {
        printf("S: %s", buffer);
        if (nClient > 1) {
            dispatch(fd, i);
        }
        if (strcmp(buffer, MSG_C) == 0) {
            if (send(fd[i], ACK_S, sizeof(ACK_S), 0) < 0) {
                perror("S: communication send error");
            } else {
                printf("S: send ACK to client %d\n", i + 1);
                out = -1;
            }
        }
    }
    return out;
}
```

### Solution Features

1. **Return Value Capture**: Store `recv()` result in `bytes_received` variable
2. **Three-Way Handling**: Distinguish between error (<0), disconnection (0), and data (>0)
3. **Proper Signaling**: Return -1 to main loop for connection cleanup in error cases
4. **Clear Logging**: Informative messages for different disconnection scenarios

### Error Handling Categories

- **`bytes_received < 0`**: Network error → Log error, signal cleanup
- **`bytes_received == 0`**: Client disconnected gracefully → Log disconnect, signal cleanup
- **`bytes_received > 0`**: Data received → Process normally

### Benefits

- **Accurate Client Tracking**: Proper detection of client disconnections
- **Resource Management**: Connections cleaned up when clients disconnect
- **Network Reliability**: Distinguishes between errors and normal disconnections
- **Better Monitoring**: Clear logs showing client connection states
- **Protocol Compliance**: Follows TCP socket programming best practices

## SO_REUSEADDR Value Correction

### Problem
The original server code had the correct structure for setting `SO_REUSEADDR` but used an incorrect value (`-1` instead of `1`), which would not properly enable the socket option.

### Original Code
```c
int openSocket(internet_domain_sockaddr *addr) {
    int sd;
    int optval = -1;  // ← Incorrect value
 
    // ... socket creation ...

    if (setsockopt(sd, SOL_SOCKET, SO_REUSEADDR, &optval, sizeof(optval)) < 0) {
        perror("S: openSocket setsockopt SO_REUSEADDR error");
        close(sd);
        return -1;
    }
}
```

### Fixed Code
```c
int openSocket(internet_domain_sockaddr *addr) {
    int sd;
    int optval = 1;  // ← Correct value to enable option

    // ... socket creation ...
 
    if (setsockopt(sd, SOL_SOCKET, SO_REUSEADDR, &optval, sizeof(optval)) < 0) {
        perror("S: openSocket setsockopt SO_REUSEADDR error");
        close(sd);
        return -1;
    }
}
```

### Technical Details
- **Socket Options**: Non-zero values enable socket options, zero disables them
- **Previous Behavior**: `-1` might have worked on some systems but is not portable
- **Standard Practice**: Use `1` to explicitly enable `SO_REUSEADDR`
- **Reliability**: Ensures consistent behavior across different Unix systems

## Summary of Server Enhancements

These server-side improvements address critical reliability and usability issues:

1. **🔴 Critical**: Fixed dispatch function bug causing false error reports
2. **🟡 Important**: Enhanced recv() handling for proper client disconnection detection  
3. **🟡 Important**: Corrected SO_REUSEADDR value for reliable socket reuse
4. **🟢 Safety**: Added buffer overflow protection with snprintf()

The server is now much more robust, provides accurate error reporting, and handles client connections properly according to TCP socket programming best practices. These changes maintain the original architecture while adding modern safety and reliability features.

## Advanced Error Handling: Signal-Safe Network Operations

### Problem
After implementing the basic error handling fixes, a comparison with the client.c code revealed that the server lacked the sophisticated error handling patterns already implemented on the client side:

- No handling of `EINTR` (signal interruption) errors
- No distinction between different types of network failures
- No automatic retry logic for recoverable errors
- No automatic connection cleanup for failed connections

### Client-Inspired Improvements

The client.c already had excellent error handling patterns that were worth adapting for the server:

1. **EINTR Handling**: Retry operations interrupted by signals
2. **Connection State Detection**: Identify `EPIPE` and `ECONNRESET` errors
3. **Automatic Recovery**: Different strategies for different error types
4. **Connection Cleanup**: Remove dead connections automatically

### Enhanced recv() in communication()

#### Before
```c
bytes_received = recv(fd[i], buffer, MAXCHR, 0);
if (bytes_received < 0) {
    perror("S: communication recv error");
    out = -1;
} else if (bytes_received == 0) {
    printf("S: client %d disconnected (recv returned 0)\n", i + 1);
    out = -1;
}
```

#### After
```c
// Enhanced recv() with EINTR handling
do {
    bytes_received = recv(fd[i], buffer, MAXCHR, 0);
    if (bytes_received < 0) {
        if (errno == EINTR) {
            // Interrupted by signal, retry
            printf("S: recv interrupted by signal, retrying...\n");
            continue;
        } else {
            // Real network error
            perror("S: communication recv error");
            out = -1;
            break;
        }
    } else if (bytes_received == 0) {
        printf("S: client %d disconnected (recv returned 0)\n", i + 1);
        out = -1;
        break;
    } else {
        // Process successful recv...
        break;
    }
} while (bytes_received < 0 && errno == EINTR);
```

### Enhanced send() with Connection State Detection

#### ACK Send Error Handling
```c
int bytes_sent = send(fd[i], ACK_S, sizeof(ACK_S), 0);
if (bytes_sent < 0) {
    if (errno == EINTR) {
        printf("S: ACK send interrupted, client %d may not receive confirmation\n", i + 1);
        out = -1;
    } else if (errno == EPIPE || errno == ECONNRESET) {
        printf("S: client %d disconnected during ACK send\n", i + 1);
        out = -1;
    } else {
        perror("S: communication send ACK error");
        out = -1;
    }
}
```

### Automatic Connection Cleanup in dispatch()

#### Before
```c
if (send(fd[k], message, strlen(message), 0) < 0) {
    perror("S: dispatch send error");
    // Could also consider closing the connection here if send fails
}
```

#### After
```c
int bytes_sent = send(fd[k], message, strlen(message), 0);
if (bytes_sent < 0) {
    if (errno == EINTR) {
        // Retry once for signal interruption
        printf("S: dispatch send interrupted, retrying to client %d...\n", k + 1);
        bytes_sent = send(fd[k], message, strlen(message), 0);
        if (bytes_sent < 0) {
            printf("S: dispatch retry failed for client %d, removing connection\n", k + 1);
            close(fd[k]);
            fd[k] = -1;
            nClient--;
        }
    } else if (errno == EPIPE || errno == ECONNRESET) {
        printf("S: client %d disconnected during message dispatch, removing connection\n", k + 1);
        close(fd[k]);
        fd[k] = -1;
        nClient--;
    } else {
        perror("S: dispatch send error");
        printf("S: removing client %d connection due to send error\n", k + 1);
        close(fd[k]);
        fd[k] = -1;
        nClient--;
    }
}
```

### Error Handling Categories

#### Signal Interruption (EINTR)
- **recv()**: Automatic retry with user notification
- **send() in ACK**: Treat as error (ACK delivery is critical)
- **send() in dispatch**: Single retry attempt, then cleanup on failure

#### Connection Broken (EPIPE/ECONNRESET)
- **All operations**: Immediate connection cleanup with clear logging
- **Resource management**: Proper socket closure and client count decrement
- **User feedback**: Informative messages about disconnection cause

#### Other Network Errors
- **All operations**: Assume connection is compromised, perform cleanup
- **Logging**: Standard perror() plus context-specific messages
- **Recovery**: Clean removal from active connection pool

### Benefits of Enhanced Error Handling

1. **Signal Resilience**: Server operations continue correctly even when interrupted by system signals
2. **Automatic Cleanup**: Dead connections are automatically detected and removed
3. **Resource Management**: No connection leaks or zombie file descriptors
4. **Improved Reliability**: Server maintains accurate client state even during network issues
5. **Better Monitoring**: Clear, categorized error messages for different failure types
6. **Client Compatibility**: Error handling patterns match client expectations

### Integration with Existing Architecture

- **select() Loop**: Enhanced error handling works seamlessly with the existing select-based architecture
- **Client Tracking**: Automatic cleanup maintains accurate `nClient` count
- **File Descriptor Management**: Proper cleanup prevents FD leaks
- **Backward Compatibility**: Changes are purely additive, don't break existing protocol

This enhancement brings the server's error handling up to the same sophisticated level as the client, creating a more robust and reliable chat system that handles real-world network conditions gracefully.

## String Comparison Security Enhancement

### Problem
The original server code used `strcmp()` to check for the exit command, which relies on proper null-termination of the received buffer. While relatively safe in this context due to buffer initialization, it doesn't follow secure coding best practices for length-bounded operations.

### Original Code
```c
if (strcmp(buffer, MSG_C) == 0) {
    // Send ACK and terminate connection
}
```

### Enhanced Code
```c
if (strncmp(buffer, MSG_C, strlen(MSG_C)) == 0) {
    // Send ACK and terminate connection
}

### Security Benefits

1. **Length-Bounded Comparison**: Explicitly limits comparison to the expected command length
2. **Buffer Overflow Protection**: Prevents reading beyond intended boundaries
3. **Defense in Depth**: Additional security layer against malformed input
4. **Best Practice Compliance**: Follows secure coding standards for string operations

### Technical Details

- **MSG_C**: Defined as `"exit\n"` (4 characters)
- **Comparison Length**: `strlen(MSG_C)` returns exactly 4 characters
- **Behavior**: Only matches if buffer starts with exactly "exit\n"
- **Performance**: Negligible overhead compared to `strcmp()`

### Risk Mitigation

While the original code was relatively safe due to buffer pre-initialization with `memset()`, the `strncmp()` approach provides protection against:

- Malformed client input without proper null-termination
- Potential buffer corruption scenarios
- Protocol violations or unexpected data patterns
- Future code modifications that might affect buffer handling

This change demonstrates proactive security awareness and defensive programming practices.

## Client-Side String Comparison Security Enhancement

### Problem
Similar to the server, the client code used `strcmp()` to check for the exit command when processing user input. While `fgets()` provides null-termination, using length-bounded string comparisons is a security best practice.

### Original Code
```c
// Successful send, check for exit command
if (strcmp(bufferOut, MSG_C) == 0) {
    cont = 0;
}
```

### Enhanced Code
```c
// Successful send, check for exit command
if (strncmp(bufferOut, MSG_C, strlen(MSG_C)) == 0) {
    cont = 0;
}
```

### Why This Enhancement is Important

1. **User Input Context**: `bufferOut` contains user input from `fgets()`, making length-bounded operations especially important
2. **Consistency**: Matches the security enhancement made on the server side
3. **Defense in Depth**: Additional protection layer for input validation
4. **Best Practice**: Follows secure coding standards across the entire codebase

### Security Benefits

- **Input Validation**: Explicit length control when processing user commands
- **Buffer Safety**: Prevents potential issues if input handling changes in the future
- **Code Consistency**: Both client and server now use the same secure string comparison approach
- **Defensive Programming**: Proactive security even when immediate risk is low

This enhancement ensures that both client and server components follow consistent security practices for command detection and processing.
