# GegeChat Client Improvements

## Error Handling Enhancement in client.c

### Problem
The original client code had inadequate error handling in the child process (reading task). When `recv()` returned a negative value indicating an error, the code would only print an error message and continue looping, potentially leading to:
- Infinite error loops when network connections fail
- Repeated error messages flooding the console
- No proper handling of server disconnections

### Solution Implemented
Enhanced the error handling logic in the child process (lines 93-114) to properly distinguish between different types of recv() return values:

#### Original Code
```c
if (recv(sd, bufferIn, MAXCHR, 0) < 0) {
    perror("C: child recv error");
} else {
    // Process message...
}
```

#### Improved Code
```c
int bytes_received = recv(sd, bufferIn, MAXCHR, 0);
if (bytes_received < 0) {
    if (errno == EINTR) {
        // Interrupted by signal, continue
        continue;
    } else {
        // Real network error, exit
        perror("C: child recv error");
        exit(5);
    }
} else if (bytes_received == 0) {
    // Connection closed by server
    printf("C: server closed connection\n");
    exit(0);
} else {
    // Process message...
}
```

### Improvements Made

1. **Proper Return Value Handling**
   - Store `recv()` return value in `bytes_received` variable
   - Handle three distinct cases: error (<0), connection closed (0), and data received (>0)

2. **Signal Interruption Handling**
   - Check for `EINTR` errno when `recv()` returns -1
   - Continue operation if interrupted by signal (normal behavior)
   - Only exit on real network errors

3. **Server Disconnection Detection**
   - Detect when server closes connection cleanly (`recv()` returns 0)
   - Exit gracefully with status 0 instead of treating as error

4. **Network Error Management**
   - Exit child process on real network errors with status 5
   - Prevent infinite error loops
   - Provide clear error messages

### Benefits

- **Robustness**: Client handles network failures gracefully
- **Standards Compliance**: Follows Unix network programming best practices  
- **User Experience**: Clear feedback on different disconnection scenarios
- **Resource Management**: Prevents runaway processes consuming CPU
- **Debugging**: Appropriate exit codes for different failure modes

### Exit Codes Reference

- `exit(0)`: Normal termination (server closed connection)
- `exit(4)`: Normal termination (received ACK_S "OK" message)
- `exit(5)`: Network error in child process

This enhancement makes the GegeChat client more reliable and suitable for real-world network conditions while maintaining the original fork-based architecture.
